# About This Site

I created this website to document my journeys and serve as a way for others to get to know me. Although a variety of social media platforms exist to accomplish the same thing, I appreciate the creative opportunities that having my own website offers me.

## A Mini Autobiography

I first want to make note of all of the people in my life who enabled me to "be a kid" during my childhood. Writing this section of my website gave me an extra sense of appreciation for everything that was done to give me the life I was so privileged to be able to write about here. Thank you.

<summary>I was a shy elementary schooler.</summary>
  
I went to a small, parochial school nested in the woods of Clifton, Virginia. At this point in my life, I was a timid boy who was afraid to speak up and make any mistakes. By the fourth grade, and after having grown closer to my classmates (I had the same class mates up until sixth grade), I was much more confident in myself. The timing couldn't have been more perfect, because just two years later, I started middle school in an entirely different school system with kids I had never interacted with before.

<summary>My childhood revolved around baseball.</summary>

I started playing baseball within the Little League Baseball organization at an early age. I traveled around the state of Virginia with my teammates to compete in a variety of tournaments, which heavily influenced my free time and social circles. Baseball practically became a separate lifestyle on top of school.

Come high school, I was solely focused on [pitching](https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pitcher). I liked this position for its art form; although the idea of throwing a baseball to the opposing player is straightforward, it's up to each pitcher to craft their own technique that works best for them.

While baseball could be stressful and time consuming, I walked away with a solid group of friends and some small life lessons along the way. One of my favorite sayings from a former coach was: "If you're on time, you're late".

<summary>I liked the Internet more than video games.</summary>

Unlike most of my peers, I didn't invest much time into video games (except for RuneScape, which will always have a special place in my heart). Instead, the web browser was my gaming console, and the World Wide Web (web for short) was my favorite game.

Much like this website, the web fulfilled my desires for exploration, creativity, and community. I created my own computer graphics, partook in a number of online messaging boards, and consumed a variety of content on YouTube. In fact, I was so inspired by what people were doing on the web that I decided to create my own messaging board for my classmates so that we could keep in touch after school.

I want to believe it's this exposure to the web that has influenced me to pursue web development as a career.

<summary>I studied information technology at Virginia Tech.</summary>

I realized that I enjoyed learning in college. And no, I don't mean memorizing information to prep for an exam, or even reading a textbook to complete homework. I mean actually learning with the purpose of retaining new information to build upon prior knowledge.

Anyways, the first class I ever remember being excited to attend in the harsh winters of Blacksburg was my introduction to Java programming course (taught by "Twitter famous" [John Lewis](https://twitter.com/johnlewis?s=20&t=lUOvcnwxS3418s1tNL-qaQ)). Given my past experience playing RuneScape (a Java-based computer game) and overall interest surrounding the Internet, it felt like the perfect orchestration of everything I had ever enjoyed outside of my baseball hobby. What a perfect way to figure out what I wanted to do for a living.

This intrinsic motivation to learn, coupled with Professor Lewis's teaching style, gave me an extremely strong foundation to pivot to almost anything in the programming realm.

<summary>I got a job building web applications.</summary>

I worked with some fantastic colleagues at my first job out of college. They were critical thinkers, communicators, and most importantly, empathizers. There were a number of people who specifically went out of their way to support my endeavors and give me the platform I needed to grow in my career and as a person. From the perspective of a student fresh out of college, that was all I could've asked for. There are too many people to thank, but I hope they can read this on their own accord.

That aside, I quickly realized in my first year on the job that user interface engineering (also known as UI engineering, front end development, etc.) was where I wanted to be. I was comfortable coding in JavaScript, and given the outrageous amount of time I spent on the Internet as a kid, I could easily relate to the users I was writing software for.

I joined the web development community right around the time that web application architecture was shifting across the industry. With this change came many new tools, and consequently, many hours spent learning these new tools. Although quite overwhelming, it's been a fun journey to continue learning after graduating. After all, I can say with a straight face that I wake up excited to go to my job.

<summary>I relocated to Austin, Texas.</summary>
Right now, I'm happily living on the east side of Austin. I've switched jobs (still building web applications), and ultimately feel like a new person. Additionally, thanks to my girlfriend, I've enjoyed traveling, drinking all sorts of coffee, and trying new foods. She's converted me to a foodie pretty quickly, but most importantly, helped me become more confident in myself.
