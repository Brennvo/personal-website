## A Little Bit About Me

<details>
<summary>I grew up in Virginia</summary>
  <p>
    I grew up and attended grade school in Centreville, Virginia, which is not far from Washington, D.C. Despite being so close to the nation's capital, I can't say that I spent a lot of time in the city.

  <summary>I played baseball</summary>
  <p>
    I started playing baseball in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Little_League_Baseball">Little League</a>, but stopped after high school. During my final years in the sport, I was primarily a <a href="https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pitcher">pitcher</a>.
  </p>
  <p>
    Baseball was a big time commitment; balancing it with studying, socializing, and hobbies was difficult. However, I made a lot of friends and stayed in great shape.

  <summary>I love the Internet</summary>
  <p>
    As a child, I never invested much time into video games (with the exception of <a href="https://oldschool.runescape.com/">RuneScape</a>). Instead, I was surfing the Internet. You could find me on message boards, creating computer graphics, or watching YouTube videos.
  </p>
  <p>
    To this day, not much has changed; I remain invested in the Internet and what it has to offer. In fact, I love it so much that I've made a career out of writing web applications.

  <summary>I studied information technology in college</summary>
  <p>
    I attended <a target="_blank" href="https://www.vt.edu">Virginia Tech</a> in Blacksburg, Virginia. I took my studies very seriously. Come graduation, I realized that I love learning, <i>especially</i> about technology.

  <summary>I got my first job as a web developer</summary>
  <p>
    I got my first job as a web developer in the Washington, D.C. metropolitan area. I spent my first day happily and willingly staying after work with a colleague to inspect our <a target="_blank" href="https://chat.openai.com/share/4649cf74-641b-4feb-956e-5cee35169fbb">web application's network traffic</a> for fun. I loved my team and what we did.

  <summary>I relocated to Austin, Texas</summary>
  <p>
  I desperately wanted to relocate out of the Washington, D.C. metropolitan area. A little over two years into my first job, I moved to Austin, Texas. I couldn't be more happy.
  </p>
  <p>
  In no particular order, here are some of my favorite things about where I live:
  <ul>
    <li>Laid back culture</li>
    <li>Expressive people</li>
    <li>Coffee scene/culture</li>
    <li>Dog friendly</li>
    <li>Warm winters</li>

  <summary>I enrolled as a part-time computer science student</summary>
  <p>
    Ever since graduating with an information technology degree, I've become more interested in theoretical computer science and lower-level programming.
  <p>
  <p>
    Hence, I've enrolled as a part-time student in <a href="https://ecampus.oregonstate.edu/online-degrees/undergraduate/computer-science-postbacc/">Oregon State University's postbaccalaureate computer science program</a>. It was designed for people just like me who want a second undergraduate degree in computer science.
  </p>
  <p>
    However, since I don't live in Corvallis, I must take all of the virtual course offerings. Fortunately, they're the exact same courses offered to on-campus students.
