This past year, I decided I wanted to attain a computer science education alongside my full-time job. Although I already have a degree in Business Information Technology that has given me invaluable industry skills (programming, computer networking, and database design to name a few), I've become very interested in the fundamental principles and theories of computation.

## Enrolling in Classes

There are many ways to pursue a continued education, but I decided to enroll at Austin Community College for the convenience, offerings, and price, although enrolling did take longer than expected since I needed to send my student records dating back to 2014. The most inconvenient records to retrieve were my Advanced Placement (AP) exam scores since they were no longer available online due to my last AP exam taking place over four years ago. Subsequently, I had to send a fax (yes; a fax) to [College Board](https://www.collegeboard.org/) to request my archived scores, which took them nearly a month to acknowledge. Once that was all sorted out, I was able to enroll in my first course; Calculus 1.

Most upper-level math courses in a computer science education require you to have taken Calculus 3, and although I have already taken both Calculus 1 and Calculus 2 in high school, I figured it was a good idea to dust off the cobwebs off with a course I should already be familiar with. Additionally, prior to enrolling in Calculus 1, I spent time working through a small portion of [Engineering Mathematics by Kenneth Stroud](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0831134704/ref=ppx_yo_dt_b_search_asin_title?ie=UTF8&psc=1) in order to refresh my math skills, which had gradually become less precise since my grade school days.

However, within just 45 minutes of my first Calculus 1 course, I realized that I had underestimated the importance of the course's prerequisites. The issue wasn't that I had never heard of the concepts being introduced in class; in fact, it was surprisingly nostalgic to revisit mathematical topics like limits with a teacher. The issue, though, was that I was not able to reason about these concepts as quickly as I should've been, which would have required me to spend an equal amount of time refreshing my understanding of assumed knowledge as I did on the actual course content itself. Given that I also work full-time, this was inefficient.

What I ended up doing, and what I should have done during course enrollment, was visiting the [Math Department's Prerequisite Reviews](https://sites.google.com/a/austincc.edu/math-students/placement/prereq-rev?authuser=0) to accurately gauge where my math skills were currently at, not where they _used_ to be at. In a humbling fashion, I decided to enroll in a math course two levels below where I was at in Calculus 1; College Algebra.

## Starting Class

Because of my delayed enrollment into the course (due to my own displacement in Calculus 1), I was a week behind the class from the very start. This required me to dive immediately into the textbook to catch myself up, which to my surprise, was not as foreign as I thought it would be.

Back in grade school, I didn't "read" my math textbooks; rather, our teachers would provide us with class notes referencing the problems from the textbook, and we would work them out together, only to go home and repeat the process ourselves with homework. Reflecting some more, this didn't expose me to the mathematical language, which is why likely why I recall mathematical terminology being intimidating. With that in mind, and having to read my textbook to catch up with my College Algebra class, concepts like "domain of a function", "linear equation", and "rational zeros" all became much more clear and obvious after I started placing emphasis on the _why_ to algebra and not just the _how_.

The _how_ in mathematics is the easier part, e.g., memorizing certain steps to solve a certain problem, but knowing _why_ you're applying those steps is the harder part. Knowing that piece is what brings it all together, and in fact, once you understand the _why_, the steps start to come naturally. This was a neat realization, because that is ultimately why I wanted to begin my computer science education to begin with.

That being said, I caught myself back up with the class feeling excited to peel back the layers of math I had never paid much attention to.

### Class Structure

My class was asynchronously remote, meaning we didn't have a specific meeting time for lectures. As mentioned before, this was a stark contrast to how I used to partake in math classes, but I was feeling confident given many tasks at my job require me to read, process, and apply new concepts on my own. After just a few chapters, I came to my first take-away from the class: my job significantly enhanced my ability to comprehend and engage with textbook content.

As an example, a concept I recently had to grasp at work was using a `TreeWalker` within a web page. While the actual details and explanation of a `TreeWalker` are not important for this blog entry, the idea that I had to read [technical documentation](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/TreeWalker) in order to understand and apply its application is. Having done similar tasks countless times throughout my career, my math textbook read more like English than it likely ever would have before.

Outside of textbook readings, I also partook in three types of assignments for each chapter: homework via an online learning platform called ALEKS, a free-response homework assignment (difference being you _must_ show your work), and exams.

My approach to these assignments was yet again vastly different than how I ever used to engage in class assignments. Instead of doing an assignment for the sake of a completion grade, I was doing them for the sake of my own knowledge; they became tools to asses my understanding of the concepts introduced in the textbook.

This naturally lead to me caring less about my letter grades and more about the knowledge I was retaining. The most obvious example of this were the two instances of submitting a homework assignment late, not because I was lazy, but because I knew that I was too tired to retain any new information that day. Instead, I woke up early the following days and submitted my assignments after digesting the content with a much clearer and fresh mind, which had tremendous benefits come exam time.

Obviously, not having to place as much emphasis on my letter grades is a privilege, and one that I wish other students could experience as well. I truly believe it improved my ability to retain information and be excited about the course material.

### Note Taking

Albert Einstein has a quote that I live closely by: "If you can't explain it simply, you don't understand it well enough." That being said, my preferred way to ingest new information is to read and paraphrase into my own words, almost as if I were explaining it to somebody else. Not only does this challenge my understanding of the concept, but it also assists me in revisiting the material at a later time.

I took my notes on graph paper in a [note taking application called Notability](https://notability.com/). Over the course of a couple of units, I had a system for how I structured and styled them. For indentation, I would always indent three more grid squares than the parent's indentation. For text color, I used the following:

- Purple: important chapter concepts
- Blue: example
- Gray: practice problems
- Red: mistakes

Additionally, I would often create (virtual) sticky notes alongside my bullet points to add my own commentary for situations where I might have done something confusing at a glance, or possibly add a reference to another chapter in which the step I performed was further explained.

This system made it more efficient for me to revisit my notes at a later point, because I always knew what to look for. Surprisingly, my best decision was to write practice problems in gray, because they were just clones of the (blue) examples with different numbers. This made it a lot less daunting to open my notes to study because it made them appear a lot less lengthy.

### Embracing Mistakes

One of my favorite takeaways from my experience was related to embracing my mistakes, particularly while taking notes. Instead of erasing a mistake I made (whether it be an incorrect interpretation of a concept, a failed example, etc.), I would always make certain to highlight the mistake and add a red note explaining why it was wrong. As with my other formatting decisions, this payed great dividends when I was studying for an exam. It highlighted my weaknesses and what I needed to ensure I practiced ahead of time. This also adds importance to the idea of test corrections, which were often perceived as tedious, but make all the sense in the world upon reflection. In fact, I had wished my teachers placed more importance on quiz corrections, since those often are what lead-up to the tests themselves.
