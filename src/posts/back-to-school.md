This past year, I decided I wanted to attain a computer science education alongside my full-time job. Although I already have a degree in Business Information Technology that has given me invaluable industry skills (programming, computer networking, and database design to name a few), I've become very interested in the fundamental principles and theories of computation.

## Enrolling in School

There are many ways to pursue a continued education, but I decided to enroll at Austin Community College for the convenience, offerings, and price, although enrolling did take longer than expected since I needed to send my student records dating back to 2014. The most inconvenient records to retrieve were my Advanced Placement (AP) exam scores since they were no longer available online due to my last AP exam taking place over four years ago. Subsequently, I had to send a fax (yes; a fax) to [College Board](https://www.collegeboard.org/) to request my archived scores, which took them nearly a month to acknowledge. One that was all sorted out, I was able to enroll in my first course; Calculus 1.

Most upper-level math courses for a computer science degree require Calculus 3 at a minimum, and although I have already taken both Calculus 1 and Calculus 2 in high school, I figured it was a good idea to dust off the cobwebs off with a course I should already be familiar with. Additionally, prior to enrolling in Calculus 1, I spent time working through a small portion of [Engineering Mathematics by Kenneth Stroud](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0831134704/ref=ppx_yo_dt_b_search_asin_title?ie=UTF8&psc=1) in order to refresh my math skills, which had gradually become less precise since my grade school days.

However, within just 45 minutes of my first Calculus 1 course, I realized that I had underestimated the importance of the course's prerequisites. The issue wasn't that I had never heard of the concepts being introduced in class; in fact, it was surprisingly nostalgic to revisit mathematical topics like limits with a teacher. The issue, though, was that I was not able to reason about these concepts as quickly as I should've been, which would have required me to spend an equal amount of time refreshing my understanding of assumed knowledge as I did on the actual course content itself. Given that I also work full-time, this was inefficient.

What I ended up doing, and what I should have done during course enrollment, was visiting the [Math Department's Prerequisite Reviews](https://sites.google.com/a/austincc.edu/math-students/placement/prereq-rev?authuser=0) to accurately gauge where my math skills were at. In a humbling fashion, I decided to enroll in a math course two levels below where I was at in Calculus 1; College Algebra.
